### Beatscape Music Bot

This project is a discord music bot made with **discord.js v13**. To get started  
you follow some simple commands to get it up and running!

First lets change the `.env.example` file to `.env`

```
BOT_TOKEN=
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=
DOMAIN=
ENVIRONMENT=Development
```

You can fill in the missing items with your tokens for **Discord Bot Token**. **YouTube API Key**,  
and your **Domain or IP Address** of your application.

After finishing this we can install all of our npm packages using:

```js
npm install
```

Next we can build the project because it is 100% typescript. Build using:

```js
npm run build
```

The next and final command is start up the bot in development using:

```js
npm run dev
```

Running production can just be done after building using:

```js
npm start
```
